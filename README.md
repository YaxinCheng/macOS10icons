# macOS10icons
icons for macOS Catalina

# Explanation
The icons are backuped from the macOS Catalina v10.15.5. Icons are stored in the docs/, and the folder name is the bundle id, and the icon name is the original icon file name. 

For example
```
docs
  -- com.apple.Safari
     -- compass.icns
```

If replacing the icons in the future, we can just replace the icns to the app's resources folder. For example `/Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources` with no need to change the icon name
